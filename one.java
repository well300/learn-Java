/*
Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).*/

/**
<--The Print() Method-->
There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output: **/
      System.out.print("well ");
      System.out.print(5+5);
} }
